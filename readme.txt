== Installation ==

Follow the steps below to install the plugin.

1. Upload the `custom-login` directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings/custom-login to edit your settings.
4. Design away.
5. Activate the settings by checking "Enable" in the "General Settings" tab.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are extensions? =
They are additional plugins that add/extend functionality to the Custom Login plugin. You can find all Custom Login extensions on [Frosty.Media](http://frosty.media).

= My new settings aren't showing up =
This plugin caches all settings in a transient, try clicking the new 'Update stylesheet' button to delete and refresh the cache. *This will apply to versions < 3.0*.

= Is there a PRO version? =
Well, yes and no. Since version 3.0 of Custom Login the [PRO](http://frosty.media/plugins/custom-login-pro/) version is a completely different plugin. Instead of settings to manage your login design there is a new post type where you can create unlimited "designs" and activate each one as needed. Since version 3.0 all Custom Login extensions no longer work with Custom Login Pro, but will be merged into it in the future.

= Why create this plugin? =
I created this plugin to allow for custom login of any WordPress login screen. See working example on: [Frosty.Media/login](http://frosty.media/wp-login.php).

= Where can I upload and share my cool login screen? =
Check out the [Flickr group](http://flickr.com/groups/custom-login/)! Upload and add it to our pool!

= I think I want to uninstall =
Just deactivate it. Sad panda is sad.
